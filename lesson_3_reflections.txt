When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?
If I planned on sharing this code either with a team, I would rather have a remote repository than keeping all of my work local.
Remote repositories allow multiple people to work on and view changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically say up-to-date with your
remote repository?
You may not want to have automatic updates in the case where the files you are working on in the local repository
can be altered (or broken) from the update from the remote repository.
